The renderer can practically render any type of 3D polygons defined using points and segments of lines, providing a lot of room for extensibility and usability. Here I put a demo on the engine, which I themed "How does it feel to be an Ironman?". It was a tedious job, but was fun and fulfilling!'

Anyway, in this game, you are supposed to find a way out of Boom, and may the odds be ever in your favour!",
